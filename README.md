🍉What I Learned in This Lab

Learned how to set up state variables in the constructor of a React class component to manage dynamic data such as "likes" and "dislikes."

Implemented arrow functions to update state in response to user actions (e.g., button clicks).

Used event handling to link these functions to onClick events in the UI, enabling real-time updates based on user interaction.

Integrated state variables into the JSX markup to display dynamic content (like counts of likes and dislikes), creating an interactive and user-friendly experience🍓
